# FactChecker Broswer based game about media education

An online game titled 'Fact Checker' will put you in a role of a young journalist trying to get a job contract in a well respected news organization. To win it, you need to find ways to debunk fake news by using various online verification apps during your trial work day in a newsroom.

Designed by a team of four journalists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the game aims to combat misinformation and propaganda and prevent sharing dangerous content on the Internet by engaging online news consumers from BCS speaking countries of the Western Balkans with an easy and entertaining tool.
